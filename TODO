# TODO list

  * relref doesn't work into a note shortcode: check what's possible to do:
    * explain in README how to use note shortcode to use markdown into (use {{% note normal %}}{{% /note %}} which permit to use markdown AND relref)
  * create a picture of what looks like EACH shortcode and add them into README
  * add a picture to show a wiki website with Adam & Eve theme:
    * show homepage with some links
  * create a _default/section.html (or something like that) to display EITHER list of page OR {{ .Content }} if a section contains a _index.md file
