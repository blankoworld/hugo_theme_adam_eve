# TODO list

  * relref doesn't work into a note shortcode: check what's possible to do:
    * explain in README how to use note shortcode to use markdown into (use {{% note normal %}}{{% /note %}} which permit to use markdown AND relref)
  * create a picture of what looks like EACH shortcode and add them into README
  * create a _default/section.html (or something like that) to display EITHER list of page OR {{ .Content }} if a section contains a _index.md file
  * add CSS to permit to print content (as a print.css file) with:
    * links displayed
    * font reduced (to print more text on each page)
    * delete colors (only black & white)
  * tests with travis-ci + check all version from 0.43 to 0.46 (and probably more)
  * add a search bar with a parameter to active it in config.toml + some explanations on README.md file
  * add a footer with "powered by Adam & Eve theme" + translate it in multiple language
